# Savings Circle
This is an example of a dApp that can be built with the Celo dAppKit. Read more about dAppKit at [https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/dappkit/](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/dappkit/)

A savings circle (sometimes called ROSCA in the US, or paluwagan in the Philippines) lets you pool funds with your friends to save for large purchases by paying into a pool regularly and alternating who receives the pool. For example, in a group of 12 members with a contribution of $100 per week, when it is a member's turn to receive the pool (every 12th week), they receive a lump sum of $1200. 

## Getting started
To get started, clone the repo and run `yarn` to install dependencies. Then run `yarn start` and follow the expo instructions to run the app. Please note that dAppKit requires node version 10 (LTS). To install it, consider using nvm: `nvm install 10 && nvm use 10`.

To use this dApp, you will need the Celo Wallet. Get it from [https://celo.org/build/wallet](https://celo.org/build/wallet). You fully try the experience of a Savings Circle, you will need to make a circle with other Celo users. Find them on our [discord](https://discord.gg/6yWMkgM)
